using 'i' in CSS attribute selectors, indicates that it should be case insensitive

The value attribute in form elements, is used to set or get the initial value of the form

<input type="text" value="hello"></input>
you can set or get it's value, using JS

~ selectors apply only to sibling elements that come after the said element
